            <p>Programming is a skill that is becoming increasingly sought after in the job market. Having at least a basic understanding of how software
                functions is helpful for anyone who interacts with technology.<br> 
                With a background in programming, you can get a job coding, designing software, data architecture, or creating intuitive user interfaces.
                The term computer language is sometimes used interchangeably with programming language.<br>
                 However, the usage of both terms varies among authors, including the exact scope of each. One usage describes programming languages as a subset of computer languages.Similarly, languages used in computing that have a different goal than expressing computer programs are generically designated computer languages. For instance, markup languages are sometimes referred to as computer languages to emphasize that they are not meant to be used for programming.<br>
                  One way of classifying computer languages is by the computations they are capable of expressing, as described by the theory of computation. <br>
                 The majority of practical programming languages are Turing complete and all Turing complete languages can implement the same set of algorithms.<br>
                  ANSI/ISO SQL-92 and Charity are examples of languages that are not Turing complete, yet are often called programming languages. However, some authors restrict the term "programming language" to Turing complete languages.
                Another usage regards programming languages as theoretical constructs for programming abstract machines and computer languages as the subset thereof that runs on physical computers, which have finite hardware resources. John C. Reynolds emphasizes that formal specification languages are just as much programming languages as are the languages intended for execution.<br>
                He also argues that textual and even graphical input formats that affect the behavior of a computer are programming languages, despite the fact they are commonly not Turing-complete, and remarks that ignorance of programming language concepts is the reason for many flaws in input formats.</p>

        <h3 id="Learn"><u><font color="red">What language should you learn?</font></u></h3>
            <p>You'll find a seemingly infinite number of programming languages that are free to learn and develop projects with online. With the field of technology growing exponentially each year,<br>
                 the internet is a great place to start when trying to explore the latest developments or discover a new skill.Whichever language you learn, you may find it helpful to take notes or draw diagrams detailing the steps you're taking and why.<br>
                 It's important for programmers to be able to communicate their process to non-technical stakeholders, but taking notes can also be a great learning tool. "Turns out this often comes in handy not only for the sake of creating documentation,<br>
                 but often helps in solving a single task or issue where the underlying tech is challenging to understand," offers Eric Hartzog, a software engineer

        <h3 id="Types"><u><font color="red">Types of Programming Languages</font></u></h3>
            <p>While you'll find dozens of ways to classify various programming languages, they generally fall into five major categories.<br>
                 Keep in mind that some languages may fall under more than one type:<br>
                <li>Procedural programming languages</li>
                <li>Functional programming languages</li>
                <li>Object-oriented programming languages</li>
                <li>Scripting Programming Languages</li>
                <li>Logic programming languages</li>
            </p><a href="#top">Go back to top section</a>

            <br>

            <br>
            <br>

        <h3 id="Procedural"><u><font color="red">"Procedural" Programming Languages</font></u></h3>
            <p>A procedural language follows a sequence of statements or commands in order to achieve a desired output. Each series of steps is called a procedure,<br>
                and a program written in one of these languages will have one or more procedures within it. Common examples of procedural languages include:<br>
                <li>C and C++C</li>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>Pascal</li>
                <li>BASIC</li>
            </p><a href="#top">Go back to top section</a>

            <br>

        <h3 id="Functional"><u><font color="red">"Funcational" Programming Languages</font></u></h3>
        <p>Rather than focusing on the execution of statements, functional languages focus on the output of mathematical functions and evaluations.<br>
            Each function is a reusable module of code-performs a specific task and returns a result.<br> 
           The result will vary depending on what data you input into the function. Some popular functional programming languages include:<br>
           <li>Scala</li>
            <li>Erlang</li>
            <li>Haskell</li>
            <li>Elixir</li>
            <li>F#</li>

        <br>

        <h3 id="OOPS"><u><font color="red">"Objet Oriented Programming Languages"</font></u></h3>
            <p>This type of language treats a program as a group of objects composed of data and program elements, known as attributes and methods. Objects can be reused within a program or in other programs.<br>
                 This makes it a popular language type for complex programs, as code is easier to reuse and scale. Some common object-oriented programming (OOP) languages include:-<br>
                 <li>Java</li>
                 <li>Python</li>
                 <li>PHP</li>
                 <li>C++</li>
                 <li>Ruby</li>

            <br>

        <h3 id="Scripting"><u><font color="red">"Scripting" Programming Languages</font></u></h3>
            <p>Programmers use scripting languages to automate repetitive tasks, manage dynamic web content, or support processes in larger applications.<br>
                 Some common scripting languages include:-<br>
                 <li>PHP</li>
                 <li>Python</li>
                 <li>Perl</li>
                 <li>Ruby</li>
                 <li>bash</li>
                 <li>Node.js</li>

        <h3 id="Logical"><u><font color="red">"Logical" Programming Languages</font></u></h3>
            <p>Instead of telling a computer what to do, a logic programming language expresses a series of facts and rules to instruct the computer on how to make decisions.<br>
                Some examples of logic languages include:--
                <li>Prolong</li>
                <li>Abyss</li>
                <li>Datalog</li>
                <li>Alma-0</li>

        <h3 id="Front"><u><font color="red">"Front-End" Programming Languages</font></u></h3>
            <p>Front-end languages are primarily concerned with the'user'aspect of the software. The front end deals with all of the text, colors, buttons, images, and navigation that the user will face when navigating your website or application.<br>
                Anyone with a background in graphic design or art may be more inspired to begin learning one of the front-end languages:-<br>
                <li>HTML</li> 
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
                <li>React</li>

            <br>


        <h3 id="Back"><u><font color="red">"Back-End" Programming Languages</font></u></h3>
            <p>Back-end languages deal with storage and manipulation of the server side of software. This is the part of the software that the user does not directly come into contact with but supports their experience behind the scenes.<br>
                 This includes data architecture, scripting, and communication between applications and underlying databases.<br>
                Anyone with experience in mathematics or engineering may find more interest in back-end development.
                 Some examples of back-end programming languages include:- <br>
                <li>Javascript</li>
                <li>PHP</li>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Ruby</li>
                <li>C#</li>
